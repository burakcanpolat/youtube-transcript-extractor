    - "default": Basic cleanup and analysis
    - "academic": Focus on research and educational content
    - "technical": Focus on technical details and code examples
    - "business": Focus on business insights and market analysis
    
    Each template will:
    1. Format the text to be more readable
    2. Create a summary
    3. Generate relevant tags
    4. Extract key points
    5. Add style-specific analysis (e.g., code snippets for technical, market insights for business)
