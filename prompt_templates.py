    Get the right template for processing YouTube transcripts based on what you need.
    
    This function helps customize how we process video transcripts. Each template tells
    OpenAI how to analyze and format the transcript differently.
    
    Available styles:
    - "default": Basic cleanup and analysis
    - "academic": Focus on research and educational content
    - "technical": Focus on technical details and code examples
    - "business": Focus on business insights and market analysis
    
    Each template will:
    1. Format the text to be more readable
    2. Create a summary
    3. Generate relevant tags
    4. Extract key points
    5. Add style-specific analysis (e.g., code snippets for technical, market insights for business)
    
    Args:
        style (str, optional): The type of analysis you want. Defaults to "default"
    
    Returns:
        dict: A template containing:
            - system_prompt: Instructions for OpenAI
            - response_format: How the response should be structured
    
    Example:
        >>> template = get_template("technical")
        >>> print(template["system_prompt"])  # Shows technical analysis instructions
